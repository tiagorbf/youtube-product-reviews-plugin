# Youtube product reviews plugin

This is a simple yet very useful chrome plugin for people that frequently buy online. 
Every time you open a product page in one of the supported online stores it links the product title with reviews on youtube and displays a youtube button on the page, that way you can easily click and access relevant youtube reviews.
